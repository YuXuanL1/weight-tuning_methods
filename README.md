compare different weight tuning methods

## weight-tuning module
The weight-tuning module helps tune the weights to hopefully decrease the
loss function value to obtain an acceptable 2LNN.

## regularizing module
The regularizing module helps regularize weights of the acceptable 2LNN to try
to get a well-regularized 2LNN, which has a less-overfitting tendency.
